# AMNESIA CHAT

A forgetful chat room with no usernames and no long term memory.

## Description

AMNESIA was put together during the [2020 Covid-19 Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Namibia) as a WebSocket learning exercise and allows anonymous discourse for up to 100 users at a time. Beware, it does not have any abuse protection in place at the moment. Please treat others as you would treat yourself and use your better judgement when speaking to strangers on the internet.
