## Description

AMNESIA is a small anonymous chatroom project put together during the [2020 Covid-19 Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Namibia) as a WebSocket learning exercise. 

## Getting Started

The front was put together with Tailwind CSS. I did consider using Bulma or Tachyons and might try them out depending on which direction this project goes in. This is also my first project using any JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js or Socket.io.

### Dependencies

* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Roadmap

Some short term goals to help make AMNESIA more usable.

#### Front End

- [ ] Landing Page

- [ ] BUG: Fix Scrolling

#### Abuse Mitigation
